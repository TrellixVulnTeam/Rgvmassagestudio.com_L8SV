    <ng-template mdbAccordionItemHeader>Why do massage therapists tell me to drink waster after a massage?</ng-template>
    <ng-template mdbAccordionItemBody>
      <p style="color:black">Massages are dehydrating, and our bodies are 60% water! The squeezing that the massage therapist does during your appointment releases fluids from your muscle tissues and into your vascular system.
       That means that you have to restock up on all of the water you lost during your massage. Drinking water also aids in post massage detoxification and soreness! Always make sure to rehadrate after a massage.</p>

    <ng-template mdbAccordionItemHeader>Can I exercise after a massage?</ng-template>
    <ng-template mdbAccordionItemBody>
      <p style="color:black"> It's recommended that you wait 24 hours after a massage before exercising again. Your muscles will be softer and looser following the massage and you will be more likely to injure yourself, so itâ€™s best to allow your body time to recover and settle from the massage. </p>
